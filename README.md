# Hoodie Website

This is a simple, clean, and responsive landing page. I built for hoodie product using HTML, CSS. The main goal was to practise layout 
design, responsiveness, and basic web structure and I really enjoy working on it!

# Features
- Modern and Minimal design
- Fully responsive (works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop)
- Hero section with call-to-action button
- Product Image and highlights section.
- lightweight and fast loading

# Tech Stack
-HTML5 (for Structure)
-CSS3 (for styling)
-JavaScript  (for Interactivity (e.g: carts, buttons))
-Tailwind CSS (for fast styling and utility-first classes )
-Media Quaeries (for responsiveness, mobile friendly UI)

# what I learned 
- Building a landing page layout from scratch
- using flexbox and media queries from responsive
- hosting a website using Github
- working with utility-first frameworks like Tailwind
